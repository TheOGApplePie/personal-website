              We've all mindlessly scrolled on social media before. But would
              want to deliberately scroll endlessly? <br />See if you can reach

              Unlike this website, the infinitly scrolling website pushes the
              bounds of reality by letting the user scroll endlessly in the
              vertical direction. Why you may ask? For fun of course! This is
              one of those projects that doesn't really have a meaning but was
              definitely a fun challenge. This project was also a small enough
              for me to dive into hosting a project online for the first time!

                  This website was a kind of cool website to build since it was
                  meant to loop back to the first page. While there weren't
                  technical challenges building the website, I was puzzled on
                  how to host, where to host and if I even can host online.
                  <br />I ended up choosing Netlify after doing some research as
                  their UI is very user friendly. It was also free to begin with
                  which was a bonus.

                  This project is comprised of HTML, CSS and some JS. There was
                  no need to do anything fancy here since the goal was to get
                  myself introduced to web hosting
